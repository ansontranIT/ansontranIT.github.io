				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hello, my name is Anson Tran. I was born in Melbourne Australia. I’m an Australian born Chinese. I speak English and Cantonese. My previous education is VCE and a Diploma of Screen and Media. I enjoy reading books, especially ones abouts history and fantasy. My favourite childhood book series is the Peter Jackson series. Here’s a short snippet of what I have done previously. Credits to Lucas, Liam and Nick on our Tintin Project.

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT lies in the infinite possibilities that can happen due to it. Technology is ever-evolving and new trends are seemingly pushed out every single year. I’ve always been amazed at how fast technology has been moving and how easy it has made our lives.</p>
					<p>Elon Musk is my role model. He is the person that made me have  I’ve read through his autobiography and am amazed at his life experiences pioneering awesome changes with his companies. It’s just amazing what can be done with technology.</p>
					<p>Some IT experiences I had stems more from the realm of installing hardware infrastructure and setting up the devices for the users. I’ve always been dealing with IT when I was younger. If there was a problem with any of my devices I would always spend a lot of time figuring out what the problem is and how to fix it.</p>
					
					<h3>Why choose RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose to come to study at RMIT because I believe that it is the best place for me to grow as a person and experience new things. Not only that, RMIT is ranked in the top 150 globally for Computer Science and Information Systems programs. RMIT’s practical and highly up to date courses that provide job-ready skills is really appealing to me as I value hands-on learning rather than just theoretical learning.</p>
					<p>The location of RMIT is also conveniently situated right in the CBD area which makes it a great location to hang out with friends after classes or scout for job opportunities. The proximity RMIT has with multiple businesses also makes it a great opportunity to network with potential future employers as a student.</p>
				
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies</h3>
					<p>I am currently studying the “Bachelor of Information Technology” and am going to pursue Security and Cloud Computing as a specialisation for my degree. General skills that I expect to learn from the mandatory courses would be; programming languages such as python, javascript and SQL, foundational skills in computing and web design and software engineering fundamentals.</p>
					<p>From reading the major stream for IT I’m expecting to learn a lot of foundational skills in cybersecurity such as penetration testing, risk management, networking basics, toolkit maintenance, and holistic awareness of the impact of cybersecurity on the company and on the employees as well. Cloud technology such as AWS and Microsoft Azure would be a must as well.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Job Title CISO</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This position is part of the C-suite level of executives that are responsible for the defence and safety of the company’s information and technologies, and consumer and client details. They are required to respond to incidents, establish appropriate standards and controls, manage security technologies, and direct the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures.
As such the CISO is also responsible for information-related compliance. Being part of the C-suite level, the CISO works with other executives to make sure the company is growing and providing profit to the shareholders.
</p>
<h3>Why does this appeal to you?</h3>
<p>The reason why this appeals to me is that it is a very challenging role that not only requires technical ability but also business acumen and the ability to manage people. The responsibility to steer the direction of security in an organisation is amazing as you are making something worthwhile and impactful to people. Something to be proud of, especially when going from zero to one hundred.

	Just seeing the impact of your changes draws me into the role and I hope that one day I will be able to impact the lives of people in a meaningful way through security.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills are required for this position?</h3>
	<p>From what I’ve researched and from the job listing to be a CISO you need to have at the very least 7- 12 years of experience within the field of cyber-security, 5 of those years holding positions of management such as IT manager/Security Manager and also holding certifications such as CISSP and CISM. This is a senior position of cybersecurity that requires both business acumen and technical skills.</p>
	<p>For education people in this role are expected to have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related field. There is also an increasing trend of having a Masters Degree with a security focus, such as our RMIT’s Master of Cyber Security. Some sources also state that having a business degree, such as an MBA, would be extremely useful for the position. Professional Certifications include the aforementioned CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and the CISM (Certified Information Security Manager).</p>
	<p>The typical skills that are required for the business side of a CISO include project management, financial management, and people management. CISO is expected to help with regulatory compliance so knowing them is needed. An example would be knowing the ASIC (Australian Securities & Investments Commission) cybersecurity guidelines.</p>
	<p>Whilst on the technical aspect, there is a huge list of expected skills. Similar to other high-level tech executives you would need advanced levels of programming and knowledge of system administration. You should also have knowledge of security-focused technologies such as DNS, routing, authentication, VPNs, DOS and DDOS. You would also need to know coding practices, ethical hacking and threat modelling, and firewall and intrusion detection/prevention protocols.</p>
	<p>However, this balance is very subjective and generally speaking the skills of the CISO is determined by what the company needs. Smaller companies may value more technical CISOs while larger international bodies may want someone with a holistic skillset balancing both business and technical skill in security.</p>

					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Currently I know basic level programming of Python, and HTML. I have done some web design before but haven’t pursued it any further. I have experience in working in teams to accomplish a project and creating the deliverables before the deadline.

						Outside RMIT I did a diploma of Screen and Media so I know how to create VFX for movies/videos using software such as Nuke and Maya. I mainly did 3D hard surface modelling during my studies however I know how to do simple video editing, colour correction, sound editing, photoshop, compositing and texturing. These skills are pretty transferable and could also be done for games.
						</p>
					<h3>Describe how you would obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience needed for the position.</h3>
					<p>My current goal is to finish my Information Technology degree with a specialisation in Security and Cloud Computing from RMIT. Following and obtaining the relevant skills from the core courses and major stream courses. I am also wanting to find a cyber-security mentor, either outside of RMIT or inside.</p>
					<p>Using resources from RMIT I will sign up and join in our RMIT Future Edge program to learn more about being Job Ready and to also increase my employability. I would also go to club events from CSIT, RMIT Programming Club and RISC to network and make friends with new people. I’ve checked out RMIT Activator’s Cyber Ready CIC and will definitely attempt to do it to build up my portfolio and resume, along with getting guidance from premier industry mentors.</p>
					<p>Outside of RMIT, I’m going to pursue CompTIA Certifications in A+, Networking+, Linux+ and Security+ during the course of my three years in RMIT. Which would provide a solid platform for me to further build on my skills.</p>
					<p>From research, I would be lucky to get an entry-level role straight out of university as in the cybersecurity field there is a lack of entry-level roles. I would try to land a help desk or networking role first if I cannot get into a cybersecurity role straight away. I know that the ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) has graduate programs and entry-level jobs which would be a valid option to take to gain some work experience in the field.</p>

					<h2>What do these test mean for you?</h2>
					<p>Personally, I wouldn’t take these tests at face value as there are way too many factors that could affect the outcome of them. The MBTI has been criticised as pseudoscience by many and due to the nature of it being a self-taken test, it is subjected to many psychological biases such as the Barnum effect and confirmation bias. The Big Five Personality test on the other hand is widely accepted as a form of psychological testing. So I would tend to believe that more than the other two. 

						My learning style favors visual learning. Which means to me that I would learn better when I see information in the form of diagrams and such.

					<h2>How do you think these results may influnce your behaviour in a team?</h2>
					<p>Honestly, I don’t believe much will change how I would normally work in a team. I’ll simply follow the team leader and provide thoughtful and valid input when the need arises. Should mostly be smooth sailing. I’ve experience in working in teams with a variety of differing personalities and am flexible enough to work with them.
						</p>

				<article>
					<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
					<p>In the context of forming a team, my ideal formation would be one where there is a definite hierarchy in place with everyone knowing what exactly they will be doing. Ideally I would try to make sure that there would be no personality clashes in the team when forming one.

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h1>Network Security RMIT Case Study</h1>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This project is a Cyber Security project aiming for students to understand the impact of cyber attacks on a network. Through researching security policies and actions taken during the aftermath of the attack to prevent future incursion, and then compiling all their research into creating a website to educate others.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Cybercrimes are highly dangerous and as time goes past cyber security is going to be more and more important. We are very well connected in this day and age. With the help of technology doing things has never been easier. However, this has provided a new venue for people to exploit.

						Cybersecurity is an arms race. The more better developed defences are the more better developed attacks are. People need to be educated on why and how attacks occur and how they can contribute to the safety of their cyberspace.
						
						The first step would be to educate people on cyberattacks and how they could mitigate the risks of it happening.
						</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Students will first be researching RMIT security standards, security systems, and authentication protocols with permission and supervision from an appropriate staff member. They will interview staff members and department heads to ascertain specific security concerns and issues and provide a post-security analysis on the recent RMIT cyber attack.</p>
					<p>Students need to create reports detailing all the ins and outs of the procedures, standards, endpoints etc. They will develop a risk assessment report for the case study. For each threat, the report should describe the risk, vulnerabilities and value. Along with the impact and likelihood of occurrence and control recommendations.</p>
					<p>Key questions we need to ask are:</p>
					<div class=nlist>
					<ul>
						<li>What are RMIT's most important information technology assets?</li>
						<li>What data breach would have a major impact on RMIT?</li>
						<li>What are the relevant threats and the threat sources?</li>
						<li>What are the internal and external vulnerabilities?</li>
						<li>What is the impact if those vulnerabilities are exploited?</li>
						<li>What is the likelihood of exploitation?</li>
						<li>What cyber attacks, cyber threats, or security incidents could impact the ability of the university to function?</li>
						<li>What is the level of risk that RMIT can take?</li>
					  </ul>
					  </div>
					
					  <p>After research students would begin creating a website with the purpose of educating students on digital safety through using the recent RMIT cyber attack as a case study. Providing risk analyses and security assessments based on what they find. Showcasing the impact of the attack and recommending actions that students could do in order to prevent any future cases happening and/or mitigating the risks of them compromising their data. End deliverable would be a functioning website that educates people on the effects of cyber attacks and how to potentially mitigate them.
						</p>
						<p>For the website creation. Firstly, the goal of the website is to be able to educate people on the impact of a cyber attack and ways that could be done to mitigate the effect. From that we would need to define a scope of what the website functions can be. I’m thinking around 3-6 pages depending on what information the team deems relevant for the website.</p>
						<p>Next we would design a sitemap detailing the information each page would contain. At this stage we would discuss what sort of features would be implemented and design the look of the website on paper using wireframes. We would also begin to create the mood board to define the design direction of the website.</p>
						<p>Afterwards is the meat of the process. This stage we would begin to use the research data we’ve accumulated and begin to create the content of the site. We would write the content in a concise way so non-technical people may understand it. The goal of the website is to educate all people. Royalty free imagery or self-made imagery will be considered and implemented with purpose to enhance the content.</p>
						<p>Lastly we would need to test the website to make sure that everything is working and that there are no bugs to squash. Afterwards we would either launch the website through the use of github.io or using a purchased domain name and web provider.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<div class=nlist>
					<ul>
						<li>For coding the website we would be using any software that you can write code on. Personally I would be using Microsoft Visual Studio.</li>
						<li>HTML: Coding language used to create the website.</li>
						<li>CSS: Used to describe the presentation of the website.</li>
						<li>JS: Used for advanced web programming.</li>
						<li>Github:Github: Used for group projects. The group would have one repository and students would be contributing to the main repository by uploading their research data and website resources.</li>
						<li>Microsoft Word or any other sort of word processing software to type up the technical reports, whitepaper deliverables etc.</li>
						<li>Laptop/Computer: Used for research, report writing and creating the website</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required for this project includes:</p>
					<div class=nlist>
					<ul>
						<li>Technical writing skill to format and write up the deliverables</li>
						<li>Clean and concise communication skills</li>
						<li>Teamwork and interpersonal skills</li>
						<li>Knowledge on Web development</li>
						<li>Critical thinking</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Some coding experience with HTML, CSS, and JS would be needed to create the website. As well as creative design skills for the layout of the site. Group members would be expected to be competent with using computers and able to work together to finish the project.</p>
					<p>Depending on how complex the group wants the website to be, there would need to be lots of outside study of web design and programming as generally speaking most wouldn’t have done any web programming in RMIT yet.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Upon successful completion of this project. Students would:</p>
					<div class=nlist>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop an understanding of corporate protocols regarding security through their research into RMIT security policies.</li>
						<li>Foster their communication, interpersonal and critical thinking skills through interviews with staff members.</li>
						<li>Know how to write technical reports based on research data.</li>
						<li>Know how to create a functioning website with multiple pages using HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This would contribute to introducing students into cybersecurity through a real world case study, and educate them on the effects and how to mitigate them. As well as furthering their web design and programming skills with the main deliverable.</p>
