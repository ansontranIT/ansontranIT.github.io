					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT lies in the infinite possibilities that can happen due to it. Technology is ever-evolving and new trends are seemingly pushed out every single year. I’ve always been amazed at how fast technology has been moving and how easy it has made our lives.</p>
					<p>Elon Musk is my role model. He is the person that made me have  I’ve read through his autobiography and am amazed at his life experiences pioneering awesome changes with his companies. It’s just amazing what can be done with technology.</p>
					<p>Some IT experiences I had stems more from the realm of installing hardware infrastructure and setting up the devices for the users. I’ve always been dealing with IT when I was younger. If there was a problem with any of my devices I would always spend a lot of time figuring out what the problem is and how to fix it.</p>
					
					<h3>Why choose RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose to come to study at RMIT because I believe that it is the best place for me to grow as a person and experience new things. Not only that, RMIT is ranked in the top 150 globally for Computer Science and Information Systems programs. RMIT’s practical and highly up to date courses that provide job-ready skills is really appealing to me as I value hands-on learning rather than just theoretical learning.</p>
					<p>The location of RMIT is also conveniently situated right in the CBD area which makes it a great location to hang out with friends after classes or scout for job opportunities. The proximity RMIT has with multiple businesses also makes it a great opportunity to network with potential future employers as a student.</p>
				
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies</h3>
					<p>I am currently studying the “Bachelor of Information Technology” and am going to pursue Security and Cloud Computing as a specialisation for my degree. General skills that I expect to learn from the mandatory courses would be; programming languages such as python, javascript and SQL, foundational skills in computing and web design and software engineering fundamentals.</p>
					<p>From reading the major stream for IT I’m expecting to learn a lot of foundational skills in cybersecurity such as penetration testing, risk management, networking basics, toolkit maintenance, and holistic awareness of the impact of cybersecurity on the company and on the employees as well. Cloud technology such as AWS and Microsoft Azure would be a must as well.</p>

					<h2>Job Title CISO</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This position is part of the C-suite level of executives that are responsible for the defence and safety of the company’s information and technologies, and consumer and client details. They are required to respond to incidents, establish appropriate standards and controls, manage security technologies, and direct the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures.
As such the CISO is also responsible for information-related compliance. Being part of the C-suite level, the CISO works with other executives to make sure the company is growing and providing profit to the shareholders.
</p>
<h3>Why does this appeal to you?</h3>
<p>The reason why this appeals to me is that it is a very challenging role that not only requires technical ability but also business acumen and the ability to manage people. The responsibility to steer the direction of security in an organisation is amazing as you are making something worthwhile and impactful to people. Something to be proud of, especially when going from zero to one hundred.

	Just seeing the impact of your changes draws me into the role and I hope that one day I will be able to impact the lives of people in a meaningful way through security.
	</p>
	<h3>What skills are required for this position?</h3>
	<p>From what I’ve researched and from the job listing to be a CISO you need to have at the very least 7- 12 years of experience within the field of cyber-security, 5 of those years holding positions of management such as IT manager/Security Manager and also holding certifications such as CISSP and CISM. This is a senior position of cybersecurity that requires both business acumen and technical skills.</p>
	<p>For education people in this role are expected to have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related field. There is also an increasing trend of having a Masters Degree with a security focus, such as our RMIT’s Master of Cyber Security. Some sources also state that having a business degree, such as an MBA, would be extremely useful for the position. Professional Certifications include the aforementioned CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and the CISM (Certified Information Security Manager).</p>
	<p>The typical skills that are required for the business side of a CISO include project management, financial management, and people management. CISO is expected to help with regulatory compliance so knowing them is needed. An example would be knowing the ASIC (Australian Securities & Investments Commission) cybersecurity guidelines.</p>
	<p>Whilst on the technical aspect, there is a huge list of expected skills. Similar to other high-level tech executives you would need advanced levels of programming and knowledge of system administration. You should also have knowledge of security-focused technologies such as DNS, routing, authentication, VPNs, DOS and DDOS. You would also need to know coding practices, ethical hacking and threat modelling, and firewall and intrusion detection/prevention protocols.</p>
	<p>However, this balance is very subjective and generally speaking the skills of the CISO is determined by what the company needs. Smaller companies may value more technical CISOs while larger international bodies may want someone with a holistic skillset balancing both business and technical skill in security.</p>

					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec ultricies massa et erat luctus hendrerit. Curabitur non consequat enim. Vestibulum bibendum mattis dignissim. Proin id sapien quis libero interdum porttitor.</p>
					<h3>Describe how you would obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience needed for the position.</h3>
					<p>My current goal is to finish my Information Technology degree with a specialisation in Security and Cloud Computing from RMIT. Following and obtaining the relevant skills from the core courses and major stream courses. I am also wanting to find a cyber-security mentor, either outside of RMIT or inside.</p>
					<p>Using resources from RMIT I will sign up and join in our RMIT Future Edge program to learn more about being Job Ready and to also increase my employability. I would also go to club events from CSIT, RMIT Programming Club and RISC to network and make friends with new people. I’ve checked out RMIT Activator’s Cyber Ready CIC and will definitely attempt to do it to build up my portfolio and resume, along with getting guidance from premier industry mentors.</p>
					<p>Outside of RMIT, I’m going to pursue CompTIA Certifications in A+, Networking+, Linux+ and Security+ during the course of my three years in RMIT. Which would provide a solid platform for me to further build on my skills.</p>
					<p>From research, I would be lucky to get an entry-level role straight out of university as in the cybersecurity field there is a lack of entry-level roles. I would try to land a help desk or networking role first if I cannot get into a cybersecurity role straight away. I know that the ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) has graduate programs and entry-level jobs which would be a valid option to take to gain some work experience in the field.</p>

					<h2>What do these test mean for you?</h2>
					<p>Personally, I wouldn’t take these tests at face value as there are way too many factors that could affect the outcome of them. The MBTI has been criticised as pseudoscience by many and due to the nature of it being a self-taken test, it is subjected to many psychological biases such as the Barnum effect and confirmation bias. In the same case with the 9 Engram Test, many psychological organisations have criticised the validity of the test and condemned it as pseudoscience. The Big Five Personality test on the other hand is widely accepted as a form of psychological testing. So I would tend to believe that more than the other two. 

						However, at the end of the day for me, it is actions that matter. These tests don’t establish the full picture of a person. As a guideline of what to expect, sure. As factual evidence, no.
